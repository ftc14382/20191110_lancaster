Videos of autonomous from the Lancaster 2019 Scrimmage.

Match details can be found here: http://www.ftcpenn.org/ftc-events/2019-2020-season/lancaster-scrimmage/match-results-details

We participated in: Q3, Q6, Q9, Q13, and Q19. There was a problem with the video of Q19, so it is not on this page. I must have hit "slow motion" at some point. It was humorous, but the file size was to large to put the file in the repo.

We haven't spent much time logging, so there are no logs for the scrimmage.

Three out of 5 matches, we scored all of the autonomous points for our alliance. The other two matches, we scored half the points. There was only
one match (Q3) where we failed to grab a stone.

## Q3

Stones: 3,6

**5/10 Points** Tried to grab Skystone at 6. Failed to grab it. Parked on the line.

## Q6

Stones: 1,4

**7/7 Points** Grabbed stone 5, the stone to the right (greater Y) of the Skystone. Delivered and parked.
This was the best auto of the day for our bot.

## Q9

Stones: 2,5 

**2/2 Points** Grabbed stone 3, the stone to the left (greater Y) of the Skystone. It looks like we
got points for getting the stone across (2) but not for parking. The bot backed up a bit too much.

## Q13

Stones: 1,4

**7/7 Points** Grabbed stone 3, the stone to the right (lesser Y) of the Skystone. It looks like we got points for both delivery and placement.

## Q19

Stones: 3,6

**5/10 Points** Grabbed stone 5, the stone to the right (lesser Y) of the Skystone. The bot almost delivered the stone, but didn't get all the way in. We got points for parking/navigating.
